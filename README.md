Responsive Grid CSS Website Layout from Scratch

In this Responsive Web page we explore how to use the Grid system in CSS.
I also incorporated a basic NavBar that has a black background when 
the cursor is placed over the button. 

I used Variables in the CSS to use for repeated lines of code. Also used Wrapper, Showcase, 
Grid-Templates and Media Queries.
